          The high water width (W‚ÇÅ) is measured at the high water mark, which is the level reached during bankfull flow conditions. This is typically indicated by:

        <ul className="info-list">
          <li>Rafted debris deposits along the banks</li>
          <li>Recent scour marks from stream flow</li>
          <li>The point below which vegetation is lacking</li>
          <li>A distinct change in bank material or soil</li>
          <li>The level that approximates the mean annual flood (Q‚ÇÇ)</li>

          <p className="step-title">To measure high water width:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Identify a uniform stream reach with clear high water indicators.</li>
            <li>Select 3-5 representative cross-sections along this reach.</li>
            <li>At each cross-section, stretch a measuring tape straight across from high water mark to high water mark.</li>
            <li>Record each measurement and calculate the average.</li>

            <strong>Note:</strong> The high water width is the most critical measurement for properly sizing culverts using the California Method, as it directly corresponds to the required hydraulic capacity of the structure.
