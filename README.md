# AI-Forester-App

A mobile application for forestry professionals to perform field calculations and collect data.

## Project Setup

1. Install Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npx expo start`
4. Scan the QR code with Expo Go app on your mobile device

## Current Status

We've rebuilt the application from scratch to resolve persistent issues with React Native Gesture Handler and TypeScript.

Navigation structure is fully implemented with consistent routing for all tools. The Culvert Sizing Tool is now functional with California sizing method and integrated fish passage requirements. Road Risk Assessment navigation is fixed.

## Features

  - California Sizing Method (primary): Sizes culverts based on 1.2 Ã— bankfull width
  - Hydraulic Capacity Check (secondary): Verifies culvert can pass bankfull flow
- Automatic embedding integration for fish passage requirements
- Visual results showing culvert dimensions and embedding
- Option to save calculations as drafts for later reference

### Road Risk Assessment
- Form-based tool for evaluating forest road risk factors (in progress)
