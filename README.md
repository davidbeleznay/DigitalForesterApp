## ‚öñÔ∏è **Professional Use Notes**

This application is designed for use by qualified forestry professionals, engineers, and technicians. Both tools provide complete workflows for systematic evaluation using professional methodologies with a unified, intuitive interface that reduces user error and improves data quality while maintaining professional standards and regulatory compliance requirements.

The Culvert Sizing Tool now includes professional climate change projections specifically calibrated for coastal British Columbia, based on recommendations from PCIC (Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium) and EGBC (Engineers and Geoscientists BC). The climate factor presets provide scientifically-backed multipliers for different planning horizons, helping professionals design resilient infrastructure for future climate conditions.

The complete debris transport assessment evaluates 5 key hazard indicators and automatically classifies debris risk as LOW, MODERATE, or HIGH, applying appropriate area multipliers (1.00/1.20/1.40) to ensure adequate culvert capacity for debris transport. HIGH hazard classifications trigger recommendations for Professional Engineer review.

**IMPORTANT**: The application now provides a complete, professional-grade workflow that:
- ‚úÖ **Functions end-to-end** from site information through measurements, settings, and professional results
- ‚úÖ **Properly calculates results** that scale with stream dimensions (450mm to 3600mm range)
- ‚úÖ **Displays comprehensive results** with climate comparisons, debris assessments, and method analysis
- ‚úÖ **Provides realistic sizing** with proper California Method table lookup and hydraulic calculations
- ‚úÖ **Supports full workflow** including GPS capture, multiple measurements, validation, and assessment persistence
- ‚úÖ **Includes professional features** like climate projections, debris assessment, and method comparison
- ‚úÖ **Ready for widespread testing** with live demo and deployment infrastructure
