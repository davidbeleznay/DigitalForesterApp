## Professional Use Notes

This application is designed for use by qualified forestry professionals, engineers, and technicians. Both tools provide complete workflows for systematic evaluation using professional methodologies with a unified, intuitive interface that reduces user error and improves data quality while maintaining professional standards and regulatory compliance requirements.

The Culvert Sizing Tool now includes professional climate change projections specifically calibrated for coastal British Columbia, based on recommendations from PCIC (Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium) and EGBC (Engineers and Geoscientists BC). The climate factor presets provide scientifically-backed multipliers for different planning horizons, helping professionals design resilient infrastructure for future climate conditions.

**IMPORTANT**: Recent fixes to the culvert calculator ensure that sizing results now properly scale with stream dimensions. The tool now provides realistic pipe sizes ranging from 450mm for very small streams to 3600mm for large streams, replacing the previous fixed 1200mm/2000mm results that didn't respond to different stream characteristics.
