## How to Use

1. Start the application and select a tool from the homepage
2. For Road Risk Assessment:
   - Enter road name and location information
   - Rate hazard and consequence factors
   - View calculated risk score and professional requirements
   - Add photos and comments
   - Save assessment or export as PDF

3. For Culvert Sizing:
   - Enter culvert ID and road information
   - Use the GPS button to capture coordinates (requires location permissions)
   - Add multiple stream measurements:
     - Add multiple top width measurements to capture variation
     - Add multiple bottom width measurements if needed
     - Add multiple depth measurements at different locations
   - View calculated averages automatically
   - Enter stream properties (slope, discharge, fish passage requirements)
   - Configure culvert specifications and design preferences
   - Toggle climate change option for future-proofing
   - Save your draft at any time
   - Click "Calculate Culvert Size" to get sizing recommendations from both methods

4. Review History:
   - Access previously saved assessments and drafts
   - Continue editing existing drafts
   - View completed assessments

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure you have the latest version: `git pull origin main`
2. Delete the node_modules folder: `rmdir /s /q node_modules` (Windows) or `rm -rf node_modules` (Mac/Linux)
3. Delete package-lock.json: `del package-lock.json` (Windows) or `rm package-lock.json` (Mac/Linux)
4. Reinstall dependencies: `npm install`
5. Start the server: `npm start`

If you encounter any dependency conflicts:
```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Next Steps

1. Add Culvert Visualization:
   - Graphic representation of recommended culvert
   - Dynamic cross-section diagram showing water levels
   - Comparison of different shapes and materials
   
2. Add Result Export Functionality:
   - Export calculations as PDF reports
   - Save culvert designs to local database
   - Generate QR codes for field reference

3. Enhance Offline Capabilities:
   - Pre-load regional data for offline use
   - Implement offline map tiles for GPS functionality
   - Periodic background sync when connectivity returns

4. Add Advanced Design Features:
   - Multi-culvert configurations for wider streams
   - Scour and headcutting analysis
   - Energy dissipation structure recommendations

5. Implement User Management:
   - User profiles with saved preferences
   - Team sharing of culvert designs
   - Design approval workflows
